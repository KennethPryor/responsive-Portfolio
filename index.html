        <p>My name is Kenneth Lloyd Pryor.I was born in Deland, Flordia on 01/31/1999 during the
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIII" target="_blank">Superbowl</a>.I grew up with computers and was always good with computers
             or any form of technology.I remember when we didnt have internet when I was 12 so I would take my laptop to the corner of our front porch and use our
             neighbors Wi-Fi which was only 1 bar but it worked.I started working at 16, my first job was detail at a Hyundai Dealership.I washed cars and did little
             things like take out the trash and stuff.About a year later, I moved into the parts department and was a counter-person for about another year.I took a 
             web-development course in high school and learned basic HTML and CSS.I graduated Baldwin High School in 2017 and moved to Atlanta that fall.<br><br>
             I started work as a service advisor at Thornton Rd Hyundai and still currently doing that.I enrolled into a Coding Bootcamp @ Georgia Tech in 2018.
             I'm very outgoing and naturally a leader.My greatest weakness is I over think alot of things.
